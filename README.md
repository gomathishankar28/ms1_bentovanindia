# **Introduction**

BentoVanIndia(BVI) is a home kitchen which delivers home-made, vegetarian and gluten-free lunch in a Bento box to people in Eindhoven-Netherlands. BentoVanIndia offers a subscription based home-food delivery every week day.This Kitchen aims to woo Indian expats who are searching for a simple, home cooked lunch and a price to match. The menu is based on North Indian cuisine.

The reason to promote this business model in Eindhoven  is due to the presence of a large pool of expats, mostly from Indian origin. This website serves as a platform to bridge between home cooks specialising in Indian cuisine and the expats looking for a viable Indian lunch option during weekdays. Currently, this space is catered by  home cooks through Facebook groups or using whatsapp on adhoc basis and this lacks the transperancy and clarity provided by a website.

The Purpose of this website is to leverage on the familiarity of subscription based lunches in India and propose a unique offering here in Eindhoven. This site provides information about our value proposition and how the ordering process works. It aims to explain comprehensively the menu items and how they contribute to a wholesome and healthy meal.
